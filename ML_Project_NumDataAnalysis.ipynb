    "# Interpretation of Numeric Feature Distributions, Skewness, Outliers, and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Age\n",
    "**Skewness:** 0.56  \n",
    "The age distribution is moderately right-skewed. Most individuals fall between ages 25 and 50, and the density gradually decreases as age increases. The right tail contains a small number of older individuals (ages 78+), which appear as outliers in the boxplot. These outliers are valid natural extremes rather than errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers (IQR):** 143  \n",
    "These represent older individuals and are reasonable observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Age is fairly close to a normal distribution with mild skew and only a few meaningful outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hours per Week\n",
    "**Skewness:** 0.23  \n",
    "This distribution is nearly symmetric but contains an extremely strong peak at 40 hours, representing full-time work. The histogram and KDE both reflect a very concentrated center with part-time workers (1–30 hours) forming a left tail and overtime workers (50–99 hours) forming a right tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers (IQR):** 9,008  \n",
    "The IQR method marks a very large number of values as outliers because the IQR range (40–45) is narrow. These are not true anomalies; instead, they reflect natural variability in work hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The distribution is sharply centered around 40 hours, and the high outlier count is a limitation of the IQR method, not actual data issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Capital Gain\n",
    "**Skewness:** 11.95  \n",
    "This is an extremely right-skewed distribution. Almost all individuals have a capital gain of 0, with very sparse but very high values ranging from 10,000 to over 90,000. The histogram and KDE show a tight spike at zero and a long, sparse right tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers (IQR):** 2,712  \n",
    "These reflect the relatively few individuals who report significant investment gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Capital gain is a zero-inflated variable with meaningful, but rare, large values. A log transform or binarization would be appropriate for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Capital Loss\n",
    "**Skewness:** 4.59  \n",
    "Capital loss also exhibits strong right skew. Most values are zero, and the remainder cluster around a few common loss amounts (e.g., 1,880, 2,000, 2,400). The KDE confirms a sharp peak at zero with long, sparse right tail behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers (IQR):** 1,519  \n",
    "Like capital gain, these reflect uncommon but legitimate loss values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Capital loss behaves similarly to capital gain: sparse, heavily skewed, and dominated by zeros. It should be treated as a zero-inflated feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Education Num\n",
    "**Skewness:** -0.31  \n",
    "The education level distribution is slightly left-skewed. Most individuals fall between 9 and 12 years of education, representing high school through early college. A small number of individuals below 5 years of education appear as outliers in the boxplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers (IQR):** 1,198  \n",
    "These low-education values represent valid categories (e.g., elementary school).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Education number is mostly symmetric with a concentration around typical schooling levels and a few meaningful lower-end outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation Analysis\n",
    "Correlation among the numeric variables is generally weak, indicating limited linear relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age** has weak positive correlations with education level and hours worked, suggesting that older individuals may have slightly higher education or work more consistently.\n",
    "- **Education num** shows weak positive correlation with capital gain, reflecting that more educated individuals may be more likely to have investment income.\n",
    "- **Capital gain** and **capital loss** have weak associations with each other since individuals reporting one often report the other.\n",
    "- **Hours per week** shows almost no strong correlation with any other numeric variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "There is no problematic multicollinearity among the numeric features. Capital gain and loss behave more like sparse, binary-style indicators than traditional continuous variables. Age, hours per week, and education num behave as more typical continuous variables with modest spread and predictable distribution shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Summary\n",
    "- Age shows moderate right skew with a few reasonable high-age outliers.  \n",
    "- Hours per week is tightly centered around 40; IQR identifies many values as outliers, but these are normal variations in work schedules.  \n",
    "- Capital gain and loss are extremely right-skewed, zero-inflated, and dominated by rare large values.  \n",
    "- Education num is mostly symmetric with meaningful low-end outliers.  \n",
    "- Correlations among the numeric variables are weak, indicating they provide independent information for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combined interpretation provides a complete understanding of distribution shapes, skewness, potential outliers, and relationships among the numeric variables in the dataset.\n"
